The values of each cell is then binary (either 0 or 1) and represents whether or not a specific song shows up in a specific playlist. Note that this is a sparse matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, the song dummy variables are created using Pandas' *get_dummies()* method. Then, index and playlist number columns are inserted. Once this matrix is created, it is converted to a dask dataframe which allows for parallel computing. Doing this, in addition to deleting dataframes that are no longer required, clears up memory errors I was initially getting on my personal laptop.\n",
    "\n",
    "The song-playlist dataframe is then grouped by playlist with the cells consisting of the aggregate *sum()* function. All non-zero sums are in turn converted to ones (I didn't want to over-weight songs that mistakenly are included multiple times in the same playlist(s)).\n",
    "\n",
    "The final step is then to take a user-input song and filter the song-playlist dataframe to only return playlists that include that song. The *sum()* function is finally applied to this filtered dataset across every column to provide sums of every song in that reduced dataframe (note that most are still zero). The recommendations are thus the songs that show up the most among all playlists that contain the song of interest!"
